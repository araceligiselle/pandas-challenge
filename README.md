Summary:
This report provides an overview of the performance metrics for different schools based on the given dataset. The dataset contains information about school names, types, student counts, school budgets, average math, and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
In conclusion, it allows us to compare the performance of different schools based on various metrics. It provides valuable information on school types, enrolment sizes, budget allocation, average scores in math and reading, and the percentage of students passing these subjects. The data in this report can be used to identify areas for improvement, understand the impact of school budgeting, and assess the overall effectiveness of educational strategies in different schools.

By comparing Maths and Reading Scores by year, here are some possible observations:

•	Trends in Academic Performance: We can identify trends in math and reading scores across different grades. For example, we may observe that reading scores tend to improve as students progress from Year 9 to Year 12, while math scores may show a different trend.

•	School Performance Variations: By examining the scores of different schools within each grade, we can identify schools that excel in math and reading education compared to others.

•	Academic Interventions: The data can help identify specific grade levels where students may need additional support in math or reading. Schools can then design targeted interventions to address those areas.

•	Curriculum Evaluation: Comparing math and reading scores can also shed light on the effectiveness of the curriculum in different subjects and grades.
